### Content Management

All portfolio content is managed through TypeScript files in the `/data` directory:

- `home.ts` - Home page content and metadata
- `aboutMe.ts` - Personal experiences and stories
- `skills.ts` - Technical skills organized by categories
- `projects.ts` - Project details with comprehensive information
- `career.ts` - Professional experience timeline
- `socials.ts` - Contact information and social links

## üéØ Code Quality

This project enforces high code quality standards through:

### Automated Checks

- **ESLint** - Code linting with Next.js, TypeScript, and Prettier rules
- **Prettier** - Automatic code formatting
- **TypeScript** - Static type checking
- **Husky** - Pre-commit hooks for quality enforcement

### Pre-commit Workflow

When you commit changes, the following checks run automatically:

1. **Prettier** formats staged files
2. **ESLint** fixes linting issues
3. **TypeScript** validates types
4. **Tests** run (when available)

If any check fails, the commit is blocked until issues are resolved.
