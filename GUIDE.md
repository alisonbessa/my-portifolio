### Code Quality Workflow

- All code must pass ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks before being committed (enforced by Husky and lint-staged).
- To manually run checks:
  - Lint: `npm run lint`
  - Format: `npm run format`
  - Type check: `npm run type-check`

### Documentation

This guide and the README will be updated incrementally as new features and best practices are added to the project.
